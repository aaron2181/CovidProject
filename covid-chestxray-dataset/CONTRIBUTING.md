**Adding metadata**

Here is a list of each metadata field, with explanations where relevant

 -  Patientid (internal identifier, just for this dataset)

 -  offset (number of days since the start of symptoms or hospitalization for each image, this is very important to have when there are multiple images for the same patient to track progression while being imaged. If a report says "after a few days" let's assume 5 days.)

 -  sex (M, F, or blank)

 -  age (age of the patient in years)

 -  finding (which pneumonia)

 -  survival (did they survive? Y or N)

 -  view (for example, PA, AP, or L for X-rays and Axial or Coronal for CT scans)

 -  modality (CT, X-ray, or something else)

 -  date (date the image was acquired)

 -  location (hospital name, city, state, country) importance from right to left.

 -  filename

 -  doi ([DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) of the research article

 -  url (URL of the paper or website where the image came from)

 -  license

 -  clinical notes (about the radiograph in particular, not just the patient)

 -  other notes (e.g. credit)
